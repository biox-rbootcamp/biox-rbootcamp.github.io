## [](#tut) Introductory Tutorials

* Lecture 1 related:
    + [vectors and matrices](https://cme195.shinyapps.io/vectors_and_matrices/),
    + [lists and data-frames](https://cme195.shinyapps.io/lists_and_data_frames/)

* Lecture 2 related:
    + [programming](https://cme195.shinyapps.io/programming/)
    +  an extra tutorial on importing data to R needs to be run locally. You can
get it by installing my tutorials with `devtools::install_github("nlhuong/rexercises")`,
Then, run a tutorial with the following command:  
`learnr::run_tutorial("data_to_R", package = "rexercises")`
* Lecture 4:
    + [base plotting](https://cme195.shinyapps.io/base_plotting/)

Tutorials might include bugs, or some unclear hints. Please, let me know
if you encounter any mistakes in the tutorials so I can fix them.

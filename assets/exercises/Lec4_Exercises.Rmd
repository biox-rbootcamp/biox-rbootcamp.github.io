## Goal

The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the most basic plotting R commands. These will provide you with very simple ways of diagnosing issues in the data, looking for patterns, etc. The functions presented in this lab will be the basics of plotting --- we will see in the next lab how to create better, publication-ready figures: the syntax is sometimes a little trickier, and although we'll try to use these better figures in the analysis as much as we can (and it's a good practice to just get accustomed to these commands), it's good to know the basics as well.


## Video

Watch the following videos to give you an idea of the most standard ways of visualizing data with R.

- a) [Histograms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaXYRf6qtEg) 

- b) [QQplots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5F62EwMF26c) 

- c) [Boxplots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh-Pd23OmVo) 

- d) [Scatter plots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmJzInKpuRE)

- e) [Plots to avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-dYnSbBTa8) 


Once you're done, go through the following lab to start applying these different visualization functions.

# Recreating a Customized scatter plot 



In this lab, you will try to recreate a [plot](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/1280-width/images/2016/07/blogs/graphic-detail/20160723_woc155_1.png) from an Economist article
showing the relationship between well-being and financial inclusion.

You can find the accompanying article at this [link](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/07/daily-chart-13)

The data for the exercises `EconomistData.csv` can be downloaded from 
the class github repository.

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biox-rbootcamp/biox-rbootcamp.github.io/master/assets/data/EconomistData.csv")
dat <- read_csv(url)
```

```{r}
head(dat)
```


1. Create a scatter plot similar to the one in the article, where 
the x axis corresponds to percent of people over the age of 15 with a 
bank account (the `Percent.of.15plus.with.bank.account` column)
and the y axis corresponds to the current SEDA score `SEDA.Current.level`.
2. Color all points blue.
3. Color points according to the `Region` variable.
4. Overlay a regression line on top of the scatter plot 
5. Plot a visualization where you overlay a fitted smoothing trend on top of the scatter plot. (hint: try the function scatter.smooth)
6. Do the same previous plot --- but for one  `Region` at a time. Plot them in a grid using the par(mfrow=c(2,2)) command.

# Distribution of categorical variables

1. Generate a bar plot showing the number of countries included in the
dataset from each `Region`.
2. Rotate the plot so the bars are horizontal


# Distribution of continuous variables

1. Create boxplots of SEDA scores, `SEDA.Current.level` separately 
for each `Region`.
2. Overlay points on top of the box plots
3. The points you added are on top of each other, in order to distinguish 
them jitter each point by a little bit in the horizontal direction.
4. Now substitute your boxplot with a violin plot

```{r}
library(vioplot)
vioplot(x1, x2, x3, names=c("4 cyl", "6 cyl", "8 cyl"),
   col="gold")
title("Violin Plots of Miles Per Gallon")

```

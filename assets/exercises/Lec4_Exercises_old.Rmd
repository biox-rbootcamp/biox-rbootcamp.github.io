# Original plot and data

For practice, you will try to recreate
a plot published in the Economist issue of July 20th, 2016 showing
the relationship between well-being and financial inclusion.

* The original graph was taken from this [article](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/07/daily-chart-13)

* You will generate this figure step by step through a series of included 
exercises using the tools we've just learned and will learn about. 


The data for the exercises `EconomistData.csv` can be downloaded from 
the class github repository.

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cme195/cme195.github.io/",
              "master/assets/data/EconomistData.csv")
dat <- read.csv(url)
head(dat)
```


# Exercise 1

1. Create a scatter plot with percent of people over the age of 15 with a bank 
account on the x axis and the SEDA score on the y axis.
2. Color the points in the previous plot blue.
3. Color the points in the previous plot according to the `Region`.
4. Create boxplots of SEDA scores by `Region`.
5. Overlay points on top of the box plots


# Exercise 2

1. Re-create a scatter plot with percent of people aged 15+ with a bank account
on the x axis and SEDA current level score on the y axis 
(as you did in the previous exercise).
2. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the lm method. 
Hint: see `?geom_smooth`.
3. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the default method.
4. Overlay a smoothing line on top of the scatter plot using the default loess 
method, but make it less smooth.Hint: use a `span` argument, for details see `?loess`.


# Exercise 3

1. Again generate a scatter plot of % of ppl aged 15+ with bank account 
vs SEDA score with points colored by region, like in Exercise 1.3.
But this time choose the colors of the points yourself.
Hint: see `?scale_color_manual`.

# Exercise 4

1. Facet  by region (`~ Region`) the the Economist plot from Exercise 3.

# Exercise 5

Finish the Economist plot:

1. Change ordering of the regions. Hint: convert "Region" column to a factor.
2. Use the seetings for the markers to best match the points on the original 
Economist plot. Note that the points are bigger and have white borders,
and specific fill colors. The following colors match the ones on the plot:
`colors <-  c("#28AADC","#F2583F", "#76C0C1","#24576D", "#248E84","#DCC3AA", "#96503F")`
3. Add a linear trend.
4. Change the axes ratio.
5. Add a title and format the axes.
6. Change the plot background and theme. Note that `ggthemes` package
has a convenient functions for generating "Economist" style plots, 
e.g. `theme_economist_white()`.
7. Format the legend.
8. Add "Country" labels yo the points.

# Data Science

## Data Science Workflow

> Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into 
understanding, insight, and knowledge.  [^1]

[^1]: [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html)

<div class="left", style="width: 50%;"> 
1. Import
1. Wrangle (tidy & transform)
1. Visualize
1. Model
1. Communicate
</div>

<right>

</right>


## `tidyverse` 

<div class="left", style="width: 70%;"> 
  
>The `tidyverse` is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data 
science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data 
structures. [^2] 

[^2]: [Tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/)

`tidyverse` includes packages for **importing, wrangling, exploring
and modeling data**.

The system is intended to make data scientists more productive. To use
`tidyverse` do the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install the package
install.packages("tidyverse")
# Load it into memory
library("tidyverse")
```

</div>

  <img src="./Lecture2-figure/tidyverse.png", height="550"></img> 
</div>

## The `tibble` package

The `tibble` package is part of the core `tidyverse`.

<div class="left", style="width: 70%;"> 

> Tibbles are a modern take on data frames. They keep the features that have 
stood the test of time, and drop the features that used to be convenient 
but are now frustrating.

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 30%;"> 
  <img src="./Lecture2-figure/tibble.jpg", height="250"></img> 
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%;"> 

`tibbles` are data frames, tweaked to make life a little easier. Unlike
regular `data.frames` they:

- never change the type of the inputs (e.g. do not convert strings to factors!)
- never changes the names of variables
- never creates row.names()
- only recycles inputs of length 1
</div>


## Using `tibbles`

To use functions from `tibble` and other `tidyverse` packages:
```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# load it into memory
library(tidyverse)
```

Printing `tibble` is much nicer, and always fits into your window:
```{r}
# e.g. a built-in dataset 'diamonds' is a tibble:
class(diamonds)
diamonds
```

## Using `tibbles`

**Creating `tibbles`** is similar to `data.frame`s, but no strict rules on column names:

```{r}
(tb <- tibble(x = 1:5, y = 1,z = x ^ 2 + y, `:)` =  "smile"))
```



**Subsetting `tibbles` is stricter** than subsetting `data.frames`,
and ALWAYS returns objects with expected class: a single
`[` returns a `tibble`, a double`[[` returns a vector.

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
class(diamonds$carat)
class(diamonds[["carat"]])
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
class(diamonds[, "carat"])
```

</div>




## More on `tibbles`

You can read more about other `tibble` features by calling on your R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("tibble")
```

# Communicating with R Markdown

## R Markdown

<div class="left", style="width: 70%">
  R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining 
  your code, its results, and your prose commentary.
</div>
  
<div class="right", style="width: 30%">
  ![](./Lecture2-figure/rmarkdown.png)
</div>


R Markdown was designed to be used:

- for communicating your conclusions with people who do not want to focus on 
the code behind the analysis.

- for collaborating with other data scientists, interested in both conclusions,
and the code.

- as a modern day lab notebook for data science, where you can capture 
both your work and your thought process.



## R Markdown sourse files

R Markdown files are a plain text files with ".Rmd" extension. 

```
    ---
    title: "Title of my first document"
    date: "2018-09-27"
    output: html_document
    ---
    
    # Section title
    
    ```{r chunk-name, include = FALSE}`r ''`
    library(tidyverse)
    summary(cars)
    ```
    
    ## Subsection title
    
    ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}`r ''`
    plot(pressure)
    ```
    
    Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to 
    prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```

The documents must contain **YAML header** marked with dashes.
You can ass both **code chunks** and **plain text**. Sections and subsections 
are marked with hashtags.


## Compiling R Markdown files

To produce a complete report containing all text, code, and results:

- In RStudio, click on "Knit" or press `Cmd/Ctrl` `+` `Shift + K`.

- From the R command line, type rmarkdown::render("filename.Rmd")

This will display the report in the viewer pane, and create a self-contained
HTML file that you can share with others.

After compiling the R Markdown document from the previous slide,
you get [this html](https://cme195.github.io/assets/lectures/test_rmd.html).

## Viewing the report in RStudio

<img src="./Lecture2-figure/rmarkdown-viewer.png", width="1000"></img> 

## YAML header 

A YAML header is a set of `key: value` pairs at the start of your file. 
Begin and end the header with a line of three dashes (- - -), e.g.

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Anonymous"
output: html_document
---
```

You can tell R Markdown what type of document you want to render: 
`html_document` (default), `pdf_document`, `word_document`, 
`beamer_presentation` etc. 

You can print a table of contents (toc) with the following:

```
---
title: "Untitled"
author: "Anonymous"
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
---
```


## Text in R Markdown

In ".Rmd" files, prose is written in Markdown, a lightweight markup language
with plain text files formating syntax.

Section headers/titles:

```
# 1st Level Header

## 2nd Level Header

### 3rd Level Header
```

Text formatting:

```
*italic* or _italic_
**bold** __bold__

`code`
superscript^2^ and subscript~2~
```

## Text in R Markdown

Lists:

```
* unordered list
* item 2
    + sub-item 1
    + sub-item 2 
    
1. ordered list 
1. item 2. The numbers are incremented automatically in the output.
```

Links and images:

```
<http://example.com> 

[linked phrase](http://example.com)

![optional caption text](path/to/img.png)
```

## Text in R Markdown

Tables:

```
Table Header | Second Header
-------------| -------------
Cell 1       | Cell 2
Cell 3       | Cell 4 

```

Math formulae

```
$\alpha$ is the first letter of the Greek alphabet.

Using $$ prints a centered equation in the new line.

$$\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta^2} = \frac{\gamma}{2}$$
```



## Code chunks

In R Markdown R code must go inside code chunks, e.g.:

```
  ```{r chunk-name}`r ''`
      x <- runif(10)
      y <- 10 * x + 4
      plot(x, y)
  ```
```

<br/>

Keyboard shortcuts:

- Insert a new code chunk: **`Ctrl/Cmd + Alt + I`**

- Run current chunk: **`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Enter`** 

- Run current line (where the cursor is): **`Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`** 


## Chunk Options:

Chunk output can be customized with options supplied to chunk header.
Some non-default options are:

- `eval = FALSE` : prevents code from being evaluated
- `include = FALSE` : runs the code, but hides code and its output in the final
document
- `echo = FALSE` : hides the code, but not the results, in the final document
- `message = FALSE` : hides messages
- `warning = FALSE` : hides warnings
- `results = ‘hide’` : hides printed output
- `fig.show = ‘hide’` : hides plots
- `error = TRUE` : does not stop rendering if error occurs

## Inline code

You can evealuate R code in a middle of your text:

```
  There are `r length(letters)` in the alphabet, and `r length(month.abb)` months in each year. 
  Today, there are `as.Date("2019-08-23") - Sys.Date()` days left till my next birthday.
```

There are `r length(letters)` in the alphabet, and `r length(month.abb)`
months in a year. Today, there are `r as.Date("2019-08-23") - Sys.Date()`
days left till my next birthday.

## More on R Markdown

R Markdown is relatively young, and growing rapidly.

## Some R Markdown advice

>- See your future self as a collaborator.
>- Ensure each notebook has a descriptive title and name. 
>- Use the header date to record start time
>- Keep track of failed attempts
>- If you discover an error in a data file, write code to fix it.
>- Regularly knit the notebook 
>- Use random seeds before sampling.
>- Keep track the versions of the packages you use, e.g.
by including `sessionInfo()` command at the end of your document.

All the above will help you increase the reproduciblity of your work.

# Programming: style guide

## Naming conventions

The first step of programming is naming things.\
In the “Hadley Wickam” [R style convention](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html):

**File names** are meaningful. Script files end with “.R”, and R Markdown
with ".Rmd"

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
fit-models.R
utility-functions.R
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Bad (works but does not follow style convention)
foo.r
stuff.r
```
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">
**Variable and function** names are lowercase.
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
day_one
day_1
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Bad (works but does not follow style convention)
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
```
</div>

## Spacing

Spacing around all infix operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)     # Good
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)              # Bad
```

Spacing before left parentheses, except in a function call

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
plot(x, y)

# Bad
if(debug)do(x)
plot (x, y)
```

Assignment use '<-' not '=':
<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
x <- 1 + 2
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Bad (works but does not follow style convention)
x = 1 + 2
```
</div>


## Curly braces

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
- An opening curly brace "`{`" should not go on its own line and 
be followed by a new line. 
- A closing curly "`}`" brace can go on its own line.
- Indent the code inside curly braces.
- It’s ok to leave very short statements on the same line

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Good
if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}
if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad
if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} 
else {
  y ^ x
}
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

</div>

## Comments and documentation 

**Comment your code!** 

```{r}
# 'get_answer' returns the answer to life, the universe and everything else.
get_answer <- function(){ return(42)}    # This is a comment
```

Comments are not subtitles, i.e. don't repeat the code in the comments.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Bad comments:
# Loop through all bananas in the bunch
for(banana in bunch) {
  # make the monkey eat one banana
  MonkeyEat(b)  
}
```

Use dashes to separate blocks of code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Generate Data ---------------------------
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 12 * x + 5

# Plot Data -------------------------------
plot(x, y)
```


# Programming: control flow

## Booleans/logicals

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">


**Booleans** are logical data types (TRUE/FALSE) associated
with conditional statements, which allow different actions 
and change control flow.

```{r}
# equal "==""
5 == 5
# not equal: "!="" 
5 != 5 
# greater than: ">""
5 > 4 
# greater than or equal: ">="" (# similarly < and <=)
5 >= 5
```

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r}

# You can combine multiple boolean expressions
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE 
TRUE | FALSE
!(TRUE)
```
</div>


## Booleans/logicals

In R if you combine 2 vectors of booleans,
by each element then use `&`. Rember the **recycling property** for vectors.

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE) & c(FALSE, TRUE)
c(5 < 4, 7 == 0, 1< 2) | c(5==5, 6> 2, !FALSE)
c(TRUE, TRUE) & c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)  # recycling
```

## Booleans/logicals


If we use double operators `&&` or `||` is used only the first 
elements are compared:

```{r}
c(TRUE, TRUE) && c(FALSE, TRUE)
c(5 < 4, 7 == 0, 1< 2) || c(5==5, 6> 2, !FALSE)
c(TRUE, TRUE) && c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
```



## Booleans/logicals

- Another possibility to combine booleans is to use
`all()` or `any()` functions:

```{r}
all(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
any(c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
all(c(5 > -1, 3 >= 1, 1 < 1))
any(c(5 > -1, 3 >= 1, 1 < 1))
```



## Control statements

* **Control flow** is the order in which individual statements, 
instructions or function calls of a program are evaluated.

* Control statements allow you to do more complicated tasks.

* Their execution results in a choice between which of 
two or more paths should be followed.
    + `If` / `else`
    + `For`
    + `While`


## If statements

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">

- Decide on whether a block of code should be executed
based on the associated boolean expression.

- **Syntax**. The if statements are followed by
a boolean expression wrapped in parenthesis. 
The conditional block of code is inside curly
braces `{}`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (traffic_light == "green") {
  print("Go.")
}
```

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

- 'if-else' statements let you introduce more options

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (traffic_light == "green") {
   print("Go.")
} else {
   print("Stay.")
}
```

- You can also use `else if()`

```{r eval = FALSE}
if (traffic_light == "green") {
  print("Go.")
} else if (traffic_light == "yellow") {
  print("Get ready.")
} else {
  print("Stay.")
}
```

</div>

## Switch statements

For very long sequence of if statements, use the `switch()` function

```{r}
operator <- function(x, y, op) {
  switch(as.character(op),
    '+' = x + y,
    '-' = x - y,
    '*' = x * y,
    '/' = x / y,
  stop("Unknown op!")
  )
}
```

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
operator(2, 7, '+')
operator(2, 7, '-')
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r, error=TRUE}
operator(2, 7, '/')
operator(2, 7, "a")
```
</div>



## For loops

</br>

- A for loop is a statement which **repeats the execution a block of code** 
a given number of iterations.

```{r}
for (i in 1:5){
  print(i^2)
}
```



## While loops

</br>

- Similar to for loops, but repeat the execution 
as long **as the boolean condition supplied is TRUE**.

```{r}
i = 1
while(i <= 5) {
  cat("i =", i, "\n")
  i = i + 1
}
```



## Next


<div class="left", style="width: 50%">

- `next` halts the processing of the current iteration 
and advances the looping index. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:10) {
  if (i <= 5) {
    print("skip")
    next
  }
  cat(i, "is greater than 5.\n")
}
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

- `next` applies only to the innermost of nested loops.

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  cat("Outer-loop i: ", i, ".\n")
  for (j in 1:4) {
    if(j > i) {
      print("skip")
      next
    }
    cat("Inner-loop j:", j, ".\n")
  }
}
```

</div>


## Break

- The `break` statement allows us to break out out of a for, 
while loop (of the smallest enclosing).
- The control is transferred to the first statement outside 
the inner-most loop. 

```{r}
for (i in 1:10)  {
  if (i == 6)  {
    print(paste("Coming out from for loop Where i = ", i))
    break
  }
  print(paste("i is now: ", i))
}
```

- Do Exercise 1.


# Programming: functions

## What is a function in R?

- A **function** is a procedure/routine that performs a specific task.

- Functions are used to **abstract** components of larger program.

- Similarly to mathematical functions, they **take some input 
and then do something to find the result**.

- Functions allow you to **automate common tasks** in a more powerful 
and general way than copy-and-pasting. 

- **If you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice, you should use 
a function instead**.

## Why should you use functions?

Functions become very useful as soon as your code becomes long enough.

- Functions will make your **code easier to understand**.
- Errors are less likely to occure and easier to fix. 
- For repeated taskes, **changes can be made once** by editing a function and 
not many distant chunks of code. Example:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
a <- rnorm(10); b <- rnorm(10); c <- rnorm(10); d <- rnorm(10)
# Bad
a <- (a - min(a, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(a, na.rm = TRUE) - min(a, na.rm = TRUE))
b <- (b - min(b, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(b, na.rm = TRUE))
c <- (c - min(c, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(b, na.rm = TRUE) - min(c, na.rm = TRUE))
d <- (d - min(d, na.rm = TRUE)) /
  (max(d, na.rm = TRUE) - min(d, na.rm = TRUE))
```


```{r}
# Good
rescale_data <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return((x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1]))
}
a <- rescale_data(a)
b <- rescale_data(b)
c <- rescale_data(c)
d <- rescale_data(d)
```


## Function Definition

- To define a function you assign a variable name to a `function` object.

- Functions take **arguments, mandatory and optional**.

- Provide the brief **description of your function in comments**
before the function definition.

```{r}
# Computes mean and standard deviation of a vector,
# and optionally prints the results.
summarize_data <- function(x, print=FALSE) {
  center <- mean(x)
  spread <- sd(x) 
  if (print) {
    cat("Mean =", center, "\n", 
        "SD   =", spread, "\n")
  }
  list(mean=center, sd=spread)
}
```

## Calling functions

```{r}
# without printing
x <- rnorm(n = 500, mean = 4, sd = 1) 
y <- summarize_data(x)
```

```{r}
# with printing
y <- summarize_data(x, print = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Results are stored in list "y"
y$mean
y$sd
```

```{r}
# The order of arguments does not matter if the names are specified
y <- summarize_data(print=FALSE, x = x)
```

## Explicit return statements

The value returned by the function is usually the last statement it evaluates.
You can choose to return early by using `return()`; this makes you code
easier to read.

```{r}
# Complicated function simplified by the use of early return statements
complicated_function <- function(x, y, z) {
  # Check some condition
  if (length(x) == 0 || length(y) == 0) {
    return(0)
  }
  # Complicated code here
}
```

**Returning invisible objects** can be done with `invisible()`

```{r}
show_missings <- function(df) {
  cat("Missing values:", sum(is.na(df)), "\n")
  invisible(df)       # this result doesn’t get printed out
}
```


<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
show_missings(mtcars)
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
dim(show_missings(mtcars))
```
</div>


## Environment

The environment of a function controls how R finds an object associated
with a name.

```{r}
f <- function(x) {
  x + y
}
```

R uses rules called lexical scoping to find the value associated with a name.
Here, R will look for `y` in the environment where the function was defined

```{r}
y <- 100
f(10)
```


This behaviour attracts bugs. You should try to **avoid using global variables**.



## apply, lapply, sapply functions

- The `apply` family functions, are **functions which manipulate slices of data**
stored as matrices, arrays, lists and data-frames **in a repetitive way**. 

- These functions **avoid the explicit use of loops**, and might 
be **more computationally efficient**, depending on how big a dataset is. 
For more details on runtimes see this [link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/gnu-r-loop-speed-comparison/).

- `apply` allow you to perform operations with 
**very few lines of code.**

- The family comprises: **apply, lapply , sapply, vapply, 
mapply, rapply, and tapply**. The difference lies in the structure
of input data and the desired format of the output).


## apply function

`apply` operates on arrays/matrices. 

In the example below we obtain column sums of matrix `X`.

```{r}
(X <- matrix(sample(30), nrow = 5, ncol = 6))
apply(X, MARGIN = 2 , FUN = sum)
```

**Note:** that in a matrix `MARGIN = 1` indicates rows and `MARGIN = 2`
indicates columns.


## apply function


- `apply` can be used with **user-defined functions**:

```{r}
# number entries < 15
apply(X, 2, function(x) 10*x + 2) 
```

- a function can be defined outside `apply()`,

```{r}
logColMeans <- function(x, eps = NULL) {
  if (!is.null(eps)) x <- x + eps
  return(mean(x))
}
apply(X, 2, logColMeans) 
apply(X, 2, logColMeans, eps = 0.1) 
```


## lapply/sapply functions

- `lapply()` is used to **repeatedly apply a function to 
elements of a sequential object** such as a vector, list, 
or data-frame (applies to columns).

- The **output is a list** with the same number of 
elements as the input object.

```{r}
# lapply returns a list
lapply(1:3, function(x) x^2)
```

- `sapply` is the same as `lapply` but **returns a "simplified" output**.

```{r}
sapply(1:3, function(x) x^2)
```

- like with `apply()`, user-defined functions can be used with `sapply/lapply`.


## Functional Programming 

> The idea of **passing a function to another function** is extremely powerful 
idea, and it’s one of the behaviours that makes R **a functional programming**
(FP) language.

The **apply family** of functions in base R are basically tools to extract 
out this duplicated code, so each common for loop pattern gets its own function.

The package `purrr` in `tidyverse` framework solves similar problems,
more in line with the 'tidyverse-philosophy'. We will learn in in following
lectures.

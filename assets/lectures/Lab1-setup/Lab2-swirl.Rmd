## Swirl course

The purpose of this first lab is to familiarize yourself with the R language. 
To this end, we will use one of the Swirl courses (which we installed during the discussion session).

Installation:

```{r cars, eval=FALSE}
library(swirl)
install_course_github("swirldev", "R_Programming_E")
swirl()
```

This will initiate a series of promts:

- Type 1 for "1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R" when prompted to install a course.
- Type 1 for "1: R Programming" when prompted to choose a course.

Go through lessons 1 through 11.

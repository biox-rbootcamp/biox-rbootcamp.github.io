## [](#accessibility) Students with disabilities

Students with Documented Disabilities: Students who may need an academic
accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request
with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will
evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable
accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty. Unless the
student has a temporary disability, Accommodation letters are issued for the
entire academic year. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since
timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at
563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: (https://oae.stanford.edu/)).
